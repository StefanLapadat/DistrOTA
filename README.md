Proof of concept project for distributed online traveling agency (something like Booking.com, Airbnb - but distributed). Idea is to build a system in which traveling agencies would connect peer-to-peer to one another and share the data about properties. 

Currently there are approximately 10 milion properties in the world online (houses, villas, studios etc). Idea here is to build a distributed system which would be able to handle synchronizing changes on all of them (availability, reservations, 
prices etc) for all the hosts in network in the most cost effective way possible. Thinking in lines of being able to host the system in the cloud and operate it for under 200 euros per month while having access to all 10 milion properties.
